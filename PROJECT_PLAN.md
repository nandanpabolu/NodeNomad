# NodeNomad - Distributed Systems Project Plan

## 🎯 Project Overview

**NodeNomad** is a distributed key-value store designed to demonstrate advanced distributed systems concepts including sharding, consensus protocols, and fault tolerance. The project emphasizes nodes that can migrate, rebalance, and adapt across the cluster like digital nomads.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Components
- **Shard Manager**: Handles data partitioning and shard distribution
- **Consensus Engine**: Implements Raft consensus for leader election and log replication
- **Migration Engine**: Manages node migrations and data rebalancing
- **Storage Engine**: Persistent key-value storage with WAL (Write-Ahead Log)
- **API Gateway**: RESTful API for client interactions
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time cluster health and metrics

### System Characteristics
- **Consistency**: Strong consistency with eventual consistency options
- **Partitioning**: Consistent hashing with virtual nodes
- **Replication**: Configurable replication factor (default: 3)
- **Fault Tolerance**: Survives up to (N-1)/2 node failures
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with automatic rebalancing
